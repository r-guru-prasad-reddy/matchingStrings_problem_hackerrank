# matchingStrings_problem_hackerrank
This project gives the algorithm along with program for the matchingStrings problem asked in hacker rank. Please check the readme file for understanding and knowing the problem 


Thank you for opening the file. So the problem statement goes as below.

There is a collection of input strings and a collection of query strings. For each query string, determine how many times it occurs in the list of input strings.

For example, given 
  input string = ['ab','ab','abc']  
  query string=['ab','abc','bc'] 
here, we find 2 instances of 'ab', 1 of 'abc' and 0 of 'bc'. For each query, we add an element to our return array,  results = [2,1,0].
The function must return an array of integers representing the frequency of occurrence of each query string in strings.

inputs required:
  input string[]
  query string[]
output:
  An array of integers representing the frequency of occurrence of each query string in strings.
